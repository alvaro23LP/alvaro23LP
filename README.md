## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a React Native application for San Rafael School, which includes features for managing students' tasks.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about accessibility in mobile applications and best practices in Firebase.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on software development projects that focus on inclusion and accessibility.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experiences with React, React Native, Godot, and more.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing video games and I'm working on developing my own game in Godot!
